# learn-rust

This repository contains a few 'toy' projects that i built while learning Rust:

| Project  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
[binary_search](binary_search/) | An implementation of 'binary search' algorithm in a slice of sorted elements
[binary_search_tree](binary_search_tree) | An implementation of 'binary search tree' structure using Option<Rc<RefCell<>
[linked_list](linked_list) | An implementation of  'single linked list' container using Option<Box<Node<T>>>
[multithread_ping_pong](multithread_ping_pong) | An application that consists of two threads that pass a 'ball' back and forth via a channels, printing either 'ping' or 'pong' respectively
[parallel_quick_sort](parallel_quick_sort) | An implementation of 'quick sort' algorithm, the chuncks of data are sorted in parallel after partitioning 
[parallel_text_search](parallel_text_search) | A multi-threaded tool to search text in a file
[readwritelock](readwritelock) | An implementation of ReadWriteLock synchronization
